Function flow during a typical audiogram test (rough overview):

- audiogram.m audiogram
- audiogram.m audiogram_OutputFcn
- audiogram.m pbStart
-- runAudiogramTrial

- audiogram.m pbYes or pbNo
-- chooseNextAudiogramTrial
--- getNextAudiogramTrial1kHz
-- runAudiogramTrial
--- genAudiogramSound
repeat until a Yes and No response occurred at 1 kHz

- audiogram.m pbYes or pbNo
-- chooseNextAudiogramTrial
--- getNextAudiogramTrialOctaves
---- getNextAudiogramTrialBorderFrequency (if at edge of range to be tested)
-- runAudiogramTrial
--- genAudiogramSound
repeat until a rough grid (approx. 10-15 trials) is obtained

- audiogram.m pbYes or pbNo
-- chooseNextAudiogramTrial
--- getNextAudiogramTrialGP
-- runAudiogramTrial
--- genAudiogramSound
repeat until pre-determined number of trials is reached

- audiogram.m pbYes or pbNo
- chooseNextAudiogramTrial (no effect)
- saveAudiogram
-- get50PercentContour
-- analyzeSingle3GivenLengthScale

Suggested to run afterwards:
- analyzeSingle3 (calculate a GP on all trials/responses, but optimize hyperparameters)
- analyzeProcess (produces a video that shows the current GP estimate after each trial, mutual information, and the most informative trial that is chosen)
